notes:
-could use more commenting in strings.py, also need print in order to test
-same issue for lists.py, need commenting and testing (with use of print)
-in clip.py, can use mystr[3:] rather than giving len(mystr)+1
-should cast one argument as float in average.py
-both dna.py and len_sum.py look fine, again just need more commenting
