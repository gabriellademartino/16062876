mark: 2 (also counted for lab07)

notes:
-the else block in lin_find isn't matched with an if so will never get run.
 just return None to achieve this functionality
-in bin_find, should return data rather than its index (didn't take marks off
 for this, just an observation)
-the code in shapeshift.py is identical to that of other students, so you
 won't get credit for it
